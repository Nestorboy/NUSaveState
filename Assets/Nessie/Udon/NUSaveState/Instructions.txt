Version: 1.5.1
Source: https://github.com/Nestorboy/NUSaveState

Instructions:
In order to save or load data, respectively call _SSSave or _SSLoad on the NUSaveState behaviour.
Once _SSSave is called, it uses the variable instruction list to get program variables from all the specified Udon programs and stores them.
Once _SSLoad is called, it begins gathering the data from the avatars, and once done, it sets the program variables on the specified Udon programs.
It is recommended to use _SSLoaded or _SSPostLoad once the data has been loaded in order to initialize it in your world.

Callbacks:
The Callback Reciever recieves custom events from the NUSaveState behaviour in order for you to use the events to initialize and update your scripts accordingly.

_SSSaved is called as soon as all the data has been saved.
_SSLoaded is called as soon as all the data has been loaded.

_SSSaveFailed is called when saving data failed.
_SSLoadFailed is called when loading data failed.

_SSPostSave is called after saving the data and the user has switched out of the last data avatar.
_SSPostLoad is called after loading the data and the user has switched out of the last data avatar.

_SSProgress is called perdiodically as the NUSaveState loads or saves data.
Progress is a float ranging from 0 to 1, and it's set to 0 once you initially start saving or loading, and then 1 when it's done.
If you're using U#, you can get the NUSaveState.Progress property value directly.
If you're using Udon Graph you can use the GetProgramVariable node to get the value of a variable called "progress".

Notes:
Every avatar can currently store up to 256 pages, each page containing 32 bytes, so the total amount of data an avatar can store is 8 KiB.
Certain data might be wise to put on a separate avatar for the purpose of sharing the data with other projects.
Most of the time spent loading or saving is taken up by the avatar having to load.
Reading a page (32 bytes) can be done almost instantly once an avatar has been detected, but it takes one frame to switch between pages.
